# Edexcel Maths and Further Maths

Banks: `edexcel-a-level-maths`, `edexcel-a-level-further-maths`

`/question-bank/edexcel-a-level-maths` and `/question-bank/edexcel-a-level-further-maths`:
every question from Pearson Edexcel's current specifications, 9MA0 and AS 8MA0
(Maths) and 9FM0 and AS 8FM0 (Further Maths). That is 447 Maths questions from 47
papers and 824 Further Maths questions from 128 papers, cut whole question by
question, because Edexcel's mark schemes and examiner's reports go by question.
Topics follow the specification's numbered areas, with no Year 1 and Year 2 split.
The legacy modules (C1–C4, FP1–3, M1–5, S1–4, D1–2) are left out on purpose.

**MadAsMaths** (6 November 2026): A-Level Maths has an "Add MadAsMaths questions" switch, off by default, that
mixes 6,477 questions from MadAsMaths' topic booklets into its topics (`madas.json` among its data). How they're cut,
tagged and mapped to this bank's topics: `docs/BOOKLETS.md`.

- **Source papers:** `fetch_edexcel.py` asks the public search index behind
  Pearson's course-materials pages for each spec code. Whole papers are stored on
  R2 under `edexcel/`, and crops under `bank/` next to AQA's.
- **Gaps:** Pearson keeps the June 2018 9MA0/8MA0 papers and June 2026 for
  teachers only. June 2019 9MA0 Paper 3 and 9FM0 Further Mechanics 1, plus the
  2018 AS Decision papers, are scanned images, so they're in the past paper
  library but not the bank. Every question has its marks, and all but 41 have a
  cropped mark scheme. The rest link to the whole scheme.
