# Tagging question parts to spec topics

`tag_batches.py split` writes batches of question parts to `.work/tag/`. Each
batch is tagged by a model reading this brief, and `tag_batches.py merge`
collects the answers into `.work/tags.json` for `build_bank.py`.

The tags were made on 23 October 2026 by Claude subagents, one per few batches,
following exactly the instructions below. To re-tag after a new exam series,
split, tag only the new batches the same way, merge, and rebuild.

## The brief

You are tagging AQA A-Level exam question parts to the topic of the AQA
specification they test.

Inputs:
- `<subject>-topics.txt`: the specification's sections (`3.1 Physical chemistry`)
  and topics (`3.1.2 Amount of substance — <what the topic covers>`).
- `batch-NN-<subject>.jsonl`: one question part per line, with `id`, `setup`
  (the start of the whole question, for context), `question` (this part's own
  words) and `scheme` (the start of its mark scheme).

For every line, choose the **topic code** (three numbers, like `3.2.2`, never a
section like `3.2`) that the part is mainly testing. Add a second code only when
the part genuinely needs two topics in equal measure (for example a calculation
that is half energetics, half equilibria). Judge by what a student must know to
score the marks, using the scheme as the strongest evidence; the setup tells you
the context, not necessarily the topic.

Practical-skills and maths-skills parts still get the content topic they sit in.
Write `batch-NN-<subject>.tags.json` next to the batch: one JSON object mapping
every `id` in the batch to a list of one or two codes. Every id must appear.
